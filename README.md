**Just stuff that I developed for personal use.**

1) Account Review Helper
    1. Sanitizer.py
    Cleans CSV data by converting text to lowercase, removing diacritics, and replacing special characters with English equivalents. Developed to sanitize improperly logged user information for Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems.
    
    2. Generate_Mails.py
    Creates all possible email address combinations from names, surnames, and domains provided in CSV and text files. Designed to standardize and generate consistent email formats for IAM use cases.

      #Script will require administrator privileges for some features.

3) Timer Game:
    A fun game for 2(or 2 teams) where a random topic is generated. Players will enter their names and choose the game time(Total game time / 2 is the player time). Each player will hit enter after saying a related word/words and the timer will automatically change to the other player's time this will continue till one player runs out of time. After that the topic changes.
